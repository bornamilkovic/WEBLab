# WEBLab
Code solution from a laboratory exercise on building a web shop in the Web Software Development course at FER, University of Zagreb.

The Exercise was to build our own web shop on an arbitrary topic (I chose a tennis shop). 

The first half of the project involved writing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to implement common web shop features, such as adding and removing products via + and - buttons,     and switching categories.

The second part focused on upgrading the project with the Express framework by implementing applicable CRUD endpoints and managing user sessions.
